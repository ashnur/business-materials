Howdy!

My name is Aaron Alan Alexander, and I think your themes are beautiful. I 
absolutely lovely working on beautiful designs, as they help me better 
understand the parameters and constraints around the book I am writing, 
[Concept of Flat Design][0], when explores and historicizes the evolution 
of design from traditional eras into the information or cyberntic age.

I have worked in the startup and enterprise spaces for 9+ years, building 
everything from Design2WP (in 24 hours) to building large-scale mobile apps 
for D&B. I know the WordPress Codex like the back of my hand, and I've build 
WordPress plugins for employee management as well as Stripe Connect 
micropayments, Bitcoin payments, and subscription payments. 

More recently, I have been exploring and developing "smart contract" writing 
for Ethereum's World Computer: https://github.com/nerdfiles/hardar But I do 
love diversify my interest as a Generalist Wen Engineer. 

Cheers,
Aaron Alexander
