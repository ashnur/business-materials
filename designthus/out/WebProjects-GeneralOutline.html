				<p class="basic-paragraph">The Project Format</p>
			</div>
			<div class="story">
				<p class="basic-paragraph">The Web site project will follow a sequence of four main phases, listed as follows.</p>
				<p class="basic-paragraph">The Pre-design: Meet and greet; assessment of objectives and needs, coding, time and hosting constraints, features of flavor; initial questions regarding design concepts; drawing stick figures; imagining what the completed project will look like; scheduling; rate.</p>
				<p class="basic-paragraph">The Mock-up: One (1) basic design is presented. The Client receives two (2) post-Mock-up revision rounds. Should the Client be dissatisfied with the design after the second round, the Client may cancel this contract or commission the Developer to continue further revisions at the original estimate. The Client is required to pay for all work completed up to this point of the project, if the contract is canceled.</p>
				<p class="basic-paragraph">The Code-wise: The Developer slings code based on assessed constraints and requested features. Valid XHTML (1.0 Strict), CSS (2.1+3) and unobtrusive JavaScript are planted and nurtured; cross-browser compatability testing guarantees consistency of appearance and functionality across Apple, Mozilla, Microsoft, and Opera Web browsers. IE6 will not be tolerated, as it is past its “sell-by” date.</p>
				<p class="basic-paragraph">The Launch: All source files, images and code will be given to the Client for safe keeping. The Client and the Developer will decide on the preferred method for publishing the completed Web site.</p>
				<p class="basic-paragraph">Additional remarks: (i) Getting the design right can be tough, so it is understood that revision is a necessary evil. That said, the daily rate will not change should the Client opt for additional features, pages or templates. (ii) Micromanagement of the project will be done through a third-party solution by the Developer.</p>

			<div class="story">
				<p class="basic-paragraph">Pay Structure</p>
			</div>
			<div class="story">
				<p class="basic-paragraph">The Total Estimate will be determined in the Pre-design phase. It is largely based on needs and constraints. The rule of thumb is to base one’s daily rate on the “going-market” trend, which currently sits comfortably at roughly $1,500 minimum. However, flexiblity is important and, in many cases, necessity trumps the “market,” whoever that is. Your project is unique, and the bill should reflect that uniqueness.</p>
				<p class="basic-paragraph">Payment structure comes in two options: either (i) the Client can pay upfront the full amount or (ii) the Client may opt to pay half of the total estimate upfront and pay the second half upon completion of the Launch phase. The Client is obliged to pay invoices in a timely manner, based on the determined pay schedule.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="story">
				<p class="basic-paragraph">More on management, time &amp; scope</p>
			</div>
			<div class="story">
				<p class="basic-paragraph">Milestones will be set which align to the four main phases. The Client and the Developer agree to an outline of what is and is not within the scope of the project. The Client has one (1) opportunity at the Code-wise phase to introduce any additional, “surprise” features.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="story">
				<p class="basic-paragraph">Copyrights &amp; Ownership</p>
			</div>
			<div class="story">
				<p class="basic-paragraph">The Client guarantees that any elements of text, graphics, photography, designs, trademarks, or other artwork provided for use are either (i) owned by the Client, or (ii) that the Client has permission to use those materials provided.</p>
				<p class="basic-paragraph">Although the Client maintains ownership of (i) the elements provided and visual elements produced in project, the Developer owns the XHTML markup, CSS and other code. The Client receives license to use the written code on only this project and its updates.</p>
