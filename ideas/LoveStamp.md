## WHAT

1. Geodesic Metadata.             Queryable Planet Specification. We have tools 
                                  which enable us to geospatially authenticate
                                  simple geometric signatures with mobile devices. 
                                  Let’s scale that to the planets.
2. Distributed Plats.             Hack the planet by helping us all reduce carbon 
                                  emissions through ecomodernism and ecocredits.
3. 'Patahashes.                   I want to bring ‘pataphysics to blockchain 
                                  thinking, the science of imaginary solutions.
4. Visualize Social Data.         Learn and grow with the LoveStamp community. 
                                  Then automate it.
5. Concept of Flat Design.        Extract principles of design applied to daily 
                                  operations and problems. Employ principles of 
                                  cognetics and haptics to simplify company’s 
                                  interactions with data.

## HOW

1. Build the essential tools, documentations, APIs to make LoveStamp 
   fundamentally open source, and its API publicly queryable. Find use 
   cases in IPFS research.

2. Plats may play a critical role in the maturation and growth of LoveStamp’s 
   family of randomization algorithms.

3. Miners will need various defensive transactions in order to authenticate 
   roaming networks. Our authentication schemes may inform strategies for 
   creating Defensive Smart Contracts.

4. Datacommons of Multiply Realizable Preferences. Lead the initiate to 
   expose our predilections and bring harmony to the growing economy of 
   LoveStamp. Much D3 will be written. Data artistry. Social automation.

5. A product should be as simple as possible, but not simpler. Evangelize 
   simplicity to problem solving.
